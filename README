                             POLICY-COND
                             ===========

                           By Robert Smith

POLICY-COND is a macro in order to select certain code paths based on
the current optimize compiler policy.

For example, given the following code:

(declaim (optimize (speed 0) (safety 3)))

(defun test-cond ()
  (policy-cond
    ((> speed safety) (+ 1 1))
    ((= speed safety) (+ 2 2))
    ((< speed safety) (+ 3 3))))

The function TEST-COND will get compiled as if it were

(defun test-cond ()
  (+ 3 3))

The optimize qualities SPEED, SAFETY, DEBUG, and COMPILATION-SPEED are
guaranteed by an implementation. They can be used as if they are
lexically bound.

Currently, any expression for the policy expression can be used. In
the future, this might change to a limited set of operators.
